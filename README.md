# Eight-Puzzle
Simple AI app to solve the common '8 puzzle' problem implementation.

The two files 8puzzle_H and 8puzzle_G will solve the puzzle using Hamming distance,
though for an easy experience I recommend 8puzzle_H.

In order to run it, simply change the END variable to the target combination and run the code.
The START variable on the run call can also be changed for the desired start state.
The code will run and show the direction in which the empty piece moved as well as the numeric move,
having the cummulative total once the puzzle has reached completion.
